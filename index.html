      <h2 class="section-title">Why Greening Inequality Matters</h2>
      <div class="subtitle">Context for understanding who benefits from global greening</div>
      <p>
        The Global Greening Inequality Explorer asks a simple question with uncomfortable implications:
        <strong>as the planet greens, who is actually benefiting?</strong> Using NDVI (Normalized Difference
        Vegetation Index) as a satellite-based measure of “greenness,” we aggregate time-series data by
        World Bank income groups and track how much vegetation has increased relative to a 2000–2005
        baseline. Our main visualization shows how high-income, upper-middle-income, and lower-middle-income
        regions diverge over time, with special attention to the period after the 2015 Paris Agreement.
        The goal of this explorable explanation is not just to display lines, but to let readers <em>actively
        compare</em> greening trajectories across income groups and reason about whether a “Greening Wealth
        Gap” is emerging.

          <h3>What have we done so far?</h3>
          <p>
            We have designed and implemented the core “hero” visualization for our project: an interactive
            multi-line chart of NDVI percent change over time, grouped by global income level. Behind the
            visualization, we constructed and pre-processed an NDVI panel dataset aggregated by income group,
            including a baseline period and derived percent-change values for each year. The D3 chart already
            supports smooth curves, per-year interpolation, and hover interactions that surface all three income
            groups at once, which encourages direct comparison instead of reading each line in isolation.
            We also built the overall page structure for the explorable explanation, including dedicated sections
            for trends, inequality metrics (Greening Wealth Gap Index), and climate drivers such as rainfall, so
            that additional coordinated views can plug into this same narrative. Finally, the site is wired up
            through GitHub Pages, so the current prototype is fully deployed and ready for iterative refinement
            rather than existing only as a notebook or mockup.

        <article class="writeup-card">
          <h3>What will be the most challenging part?</h3>
          <p>
            The hardest design problem will be building a <em>linked, multi-view dashboard</em> that stays
            readable while conveying several layers of inequality at once. We want interactions on the main
            NDVI trend chart—such as hovering on a year, filtering by income group, or highlighting the post-2015
            period—to ripple through other views like a GWGI ribbon, a rainfall–NDVI scatterplot, and a heatmap
            of greening by income group and year. Coordinating these interactions without overwhelming users
            will require careful choices about which encodings stay static, which respond to hover, and which
            should require an explicit click or toggle. Another challenge is maintaining expressiveness and
            honesty while still telling a compelling story: for example, we must avoid exaggerating differences
            through misleading axis ranges or color choices, even when we want to emphasize inequality.
            Balancing narrative emphasis, statistical nuance, and interaction complexity is where most of our
            design time will go for the final project.
